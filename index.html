      <li class="list-group-item">Chocolate Chip: Who hasn't heard of this type of cookie? Its what mainly comes to mind
        when thinking of the concept, and is one of the only ones I am personally most familiar with. Simply the idea of
        a piece of dough stuffed with small pieces of chocolate is enough to get mouths watering!</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Macarons: Derived from the french word maccherone (fine dough), these colorful cookies
        got their start in Italy in 1533, without the colors that is. It is believed that they were first invented by
        Pierre Desfontaines for the wedding of King Henry II of France, where he filled the cookies with ganache and
        stuck them together to create the very cookies we know today.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Alfajores: First created in Argentina in the 8th century, these sandwich cookies are
        made of two crumbly sweet cookies on the outside, and stuffed with milk jam (dulce de leche). For an added
        touch, a layer of chocolate or confectioners' sugar can be added. The name comes from the arabic word for
        stuffed/filled, al-hasú. As time went on, the tradition had expanded from Spain to Latin America, where they are
        a celebrated tradition!</li>

      <li class="list-group-item">Oreo: One of the more popular cookies, outside of the ones mentioned above, Oreo
        cookies were introduced by Nabisco on March 6, 1912. Mass produced since then, it takes almost 59 minutes to get
        one cookie made, and more than 123,000 tons are made per year! These are some of the most popular cookies in the
        world, and despite humble beginings, its easy to see why!</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Gingerbread: A major staple in the holidays, these cookies where first invented in
        Germany between the 16th and 18th centuries, yet the idea that brought them to the way they are today came from
        Britain. To clarify, it was the idea of Queen Elizabeth I to decorate gingerbread in the form of houses and
        people. It sprung after some were made resembling the high ranking dignitaries in her court.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Fortune: Have you ever head a chinese meal and found this inside? With how promenant
        these are in chinese restaurants, you would think that these cookies originated from China. Shockingly, the
        legendary Fortune Cookie gained its start in Kyoto, Japan. Here, they went by the name of "Japanese Cracker." It
        is believed that the cracker came to America thanks to Japanese immigrants, who later found work in factories
        thanks to the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, may immigrants couldn't open Japanese restaurants, as Chinese
        restaurants, and the food they sereved began to become more popular, and fortune cookies began to sneek their
        way into these restaurants at the same time. Although, the final nail in the coffin was the Pearl Harbor
        bombings. With the attack, Executive Order 9066 had lead to the closure of many Japanese owned buisnesses,
        leaving Chinese restaurants as the only places in America with fortune cookies. And so, it has remained that way
        for decades, and the fortune cookie still remains one of the most popular treats of all time!</li>
