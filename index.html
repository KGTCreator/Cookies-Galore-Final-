    <li class="list-group-item">Chocolate Chip: Who hasn't heard of this type of cookie? Its the main thing that comes to mind when thinking of the concept, and is the only I am personally most familiar with. Simply the idea of a piece of dough stuffed with small pieces of chocolate is enough to get mouths watering!</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Macarons: Derived from the french word maccherone (fine dough), these colorful cookies got their start in Italy in 1533, without the colors that is. It is believed that they were first invented by Pierre Desfontaines for the wedding of King Henry II of France, where he filled the cookies with ganache and stuck them together to create the very cookies we know today.</li>
