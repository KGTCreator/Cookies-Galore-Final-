    <li class="list-group-item">Chocolate Chip: Who hasn't heard of this type of cookie? Its the main thing that comes to mind when thinking of the concept, and is one of the only ones I am personally most familiar with. Simply the idea of a piece of dough stuffed with small pieces of chocolate is enough to get mouths watering!</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Macarons: Derived from the french word maccherone (fine dough), these colorful cookies got their start in Italy in 1533, without the colors that is. It is believed that they were first invented by Pierre Desfontaines for the wedding of King Henry II of France, where he filled the cookies with ganache and stuck them together to create the very cookies we know today.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Alfajores: First created in Argentina in the 8th century, these sandwich cookies are made of two crumbly sweet cookies on the outside, and stuffed with milk jam (dulce de leche). For an added touch, a layer of chocolate or confectioners' sugar can be added. The name comes from the arabic word for stuffed/filled, al-has√∫.

    <li class="list-group-item">Oreo: One of the more popular cookies, outside of the ones mentioned above, Oreo cookies were introduced by Nabisco on March 6, 1912. Mass produced since then, it takes almost 59 minutes to get one cookie made, and more than 123,000 tons are made per year!

    <li class="list-group-item">Gingerbread: A major staple in the holidays, these cookies where first invented in Germany between the 16th and 18th centuries, yet the idea that brought them to the way they are today came from Britain. To clarify, it was the idea of Queen Elizabeth I to decorate gingerbread in the form of houses and people. It sprung after some were made resembling the high ranking dignitaries in her court.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Fortune: Have you ever head a chinese meal and found this inside? With how promenant these are in chinese restaurants, you would think that these cookies originated from China. Shockingly, the legendary Fortune Cookie gained its start in Kyoto, Japan. Here, they went by the name of "Japanese Cracker." It is believed that the cracker came to America thanks to Japanese immigrants, who later found work in factories thanks to the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, may immigrants couldn't open Japanese restaurants, as Chinese restaurants, and the food they sereved began to become more popular, and fortune cookies began to sneek their way into these restaurants at the same time. Although, the final nail in the coffin was the Pearl Harbor bombings. With the attack, Executive Order 9066 had lead to the closure of many Japanese owned buisnesses, leaving Chinese restaurants as the only places in America with fortune cookies. And so, it has remained that way for decandes, and the fortune cookie still remains one of the most popular treats of all time!</li>
